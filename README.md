> Ursamu is a modern implementation of a MUSH server, a text based, intertnet roleplaying game. This work is definitely done on the shoulders of giants. This Repo is also in a very alpha state and the api is surely destinied to change as I move towards a stable 1.0.

This repo represents the core or the ursamu engine. It has the bare essentials to start an URSAMU server.
